# VGI-User-Quality-Analysis
This outlines my MsGISc capstone project.  The methods incorporate a proxy for User Quality based on the experience of the user, and their local knowledge.

Instructions for Use:
 1. Create working directory (folder) and import both datasets in shapefile format (test and reference)
 2. In 'R' import VGI User Quality Analysis to Source
 3. Change current workspace (working directory) setwd()
 4. Change filenames used for test and referene datasets
 5. Download and install required packages
 6. Run User Quality Analysis
 7. Inspect data tables and plots (within or outside of R environment)
 8. Run Data Point Filter based on input parameters
Note that outptuts include datatables, as well as the final subst in ESRI shapefile format
